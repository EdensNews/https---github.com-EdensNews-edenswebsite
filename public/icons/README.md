# App Icons

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create app icons in these sizes:

## Required Sizes:
- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

## Quick Way to Generate:

1. Go to: https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Upload your logo (preferably 512x512 or larger)
3. Download all sizes
4. Place them in this folder

## Temporary Fix:

For now, the app will work without icons, but you'll see console warnings.
The PWA will still function - icons are only needed for the home screen appearance.

## Your Logo:

Use your Edens News logo with:
- Red/Orange gradient background
- White "EN" or full logo
- Square format (1:1 ratio)
