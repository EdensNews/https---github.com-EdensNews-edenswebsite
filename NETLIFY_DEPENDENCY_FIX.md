# Netlify Dependency Fix

## Problem
Netlify build was failing with the error:
```
Cannot find module 'xml2js'
```

## Root Cause
The `xml2js` dependency was missing from `package.json`, which is required by the Netlify function `netlify/functions/fetch-rss.js` to parse RSS XML feeds.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Missing Dependency
Added `xml2js` to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "xml2js": "^0.6.2"
  }
}
```

### 2. Installed Dependencies
Ran `npm install` to install the new dependency.

### 3. Verified Fix
- ✅ Dependencies installed successfully
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ xml2js is available for Netlify functions

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Added xml2js dependency
- `netlify/functions/fetch-rss.js` - Already correctly using xml2js

## Next Steps
1. **Commit and push** your changes to your repository
2. **Deploy to Netlify** - the build should now succeed
3. **Test RSS functionality** - RSS feeds should work properly

## Verification
The build now completes successfully:
```
✓ built in 1m 27s
```

The Netlify function should now work correctly for RSS feed parsing and translation.
